- better ray-tracing/shading algorithm\\
- SIMD usage for ray tracing calculations\\
- photon mapping job processor\\
- cleaver way of splitting up and passing along tasks/batches\\
- too much overhead?\\
- end-user client as plugin for 3ds max\\
- GOOD IDEA, but only prototype. Has potential like a massive BOSS.
