\section{Raytracer}
\subsection{Algorithm}
Improved ray tracing algorithm.

\subsection{SIMD}
By using SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data), multiple computations can be performed in parallel. If used correctly, a speedup of up to 4 times per execution thread can be expected. For us, SIMD can be applied to both ray calculations and data structures.

\subsection{Photon Mapping}
Distributed photon mapping could be a possible addition to the raytracer, in order to get a good approximation of global illumination.

\section{Lightning}
Better task distribution algorithm that accounts for CPU count and CPU load for each available node. [also bandwidth between host and nodes should be taken into account].

End-user client as a plugin for 3ds max.

- too much overhead?\\
- GOOD IDEA, but only prototype. Has potential like a massive BOSS.
