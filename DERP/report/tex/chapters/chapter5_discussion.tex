In large projects when the workspace gets cluttered from wires and boxes, a user can batch components together in groups. These groups can then be minimized or collapsed in order to achieve a better overview of the project. This functionality also serves as a performance increase, as each component and wire require processing power to visualize. 

Originally, it was intended to include user custom color schemes, manipulated by a hue-shift shader. Different color schemes enable users to customize the look of the whole editor to better suit the users preferences, such as light-dark contrast as well as general visual profile.
