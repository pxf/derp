Creating real-time computer-generated imagery using low level APIs such as OpenGL directly can be difficult and error-prone.  With this project we present a simpler way of creating an advanced graphics pipeline using a \mbox{custom} built, easy to use editor. The editor has the ability to view the output-image of each step of the pipeline, making it easy to spot where something is being rendered incorrectly, making this a great tool for creating quick prototypes.
