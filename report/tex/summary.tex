Creating real-time computer-generated imagery using low level APIs (such as OpenGL) directly can be difficult and error-prone. With this project we present a way of creating an advanced graphics pipeline using an easy to use editor, with the ability to view the output-image of each step of the pipeline, making it easy to spot where something is being rendered incorrectly.
