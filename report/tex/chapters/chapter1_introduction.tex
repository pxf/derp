\chapter{Introduction}
 
 \section{Description}
The idea of this project is to build a content creation system to create materials and post-processing rendering effects in a computer graphics environment. The system is composed of several independent modules in a plug in based architecture. This application is targeted towards advanced users, experienced in the field of computer graphics as a means of fast prototyping, or for visual artists with no background in programming.

\section{Motivation}
A tool such as this, can be found within various other modern computer graphics packages, such as Autodesk Maya 3D or the Unreal Engine 3. However, both these examples (and many more) are proprietary, and are often quite costly. 
 
Furthermore, this project plans to expand upon these ideas and hopefully introduce new functionality. We consider our approach to be more dynamic and expandable, due to the plug in based architecture we plan to develop. 
 
From an academic point of view, this project will enable us to gain valuable experience in developing unique / interesting ideas in a contemporary environment.
